// Stack has to use templates:
If you run it a first time with your MutantStack, and a second time replacing the
MutantStack with, for example, a std::list, the two outputs should be the same. Of
course, when testing another container, update the code below with the corresponding
member functions (push() can become push_back()).

pushback is used for lists, push for stacks (makes sense).
